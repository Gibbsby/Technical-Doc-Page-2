                My Journey learning HTML 5 and CSS has been a very entertaining time. Most days I'd like to learn, more and more, and I have made a goal to at least learn something about HTML or CSS each day. I have come a long way, I am basically self-taught. I have been learning off of FreeCodeCamp.org, Youtube.com, and various places. I would not say I'm a professional, yet. Of course this isn't the Matrix with learning, but I'm trying.
            </p>
            <p>
                I remember learning HTML when I was younger, I also made a couple of anime websites. I did cheat, using a premade website. Not today I think, if I tried again I would definitely have to research, but I could potentially build a huge website.

                HTML 5
            </header>
            <p>
                There is a lot of interesting things about HTML 5, more advanced coders would probably think the same. "Everyone" does use the internet to visit websites. Who do they think makes these sites and How?
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to my basic knowledge of HTML, I honestly thought I could "get" everything right off the back, but definitely not. I am just a beginner in this field. Watch me do great things, I will pursue a thriving career in this field.

            <header>
                The Body
            </header>
            <p>The body is where you put all of your text, images, basic content for your page. This code is comprised of tags, and complex markup that only helps computers figure out how to "english".
            </p>
            <p>Coding is easy, I believe it will only get more difficult as I go along and learn. Since I'm capable, I will, and I can.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Paragraph">
            <header>
                Paragraph
            </header>
            <p>
                The P tag is mainly for texts, of course paragraphs for your content.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most "markup" is made of text.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Paragraphs</li>
            </ul>

                CSS
            </header>
            <p>
                Style it up! CSS still confuzzles me a lot. I honestly know HTML better at this point. I have little knowledge of how each tag should be represented.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am slowly learning a lot, I get a lot of help from this youtuber named Kevin Powell. He is very informative on all CSS. He has broken CSS down better than anyone I can see that does it on youtube.
